   - Format-preserving email sending (maintains line breaks/formatting)

3. **Management Interface**:
   - Dashboard showing uploaded files
   - History of scheduled jobs
   - Ability to view/download/delete uploaded files
   - Cancel scheduled jobs

   - Node.js backend with Express
   - Multer for file uploads
   - XLSX library for Excel parsing
   - node-schedule for job scheduling
   - Nodemailer for email sending
   - No database (filesystem storage only)
