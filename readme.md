Sure! Here’s a polished, clear prompt you can use if you want to ask for this full project — either for me or for any developer:

---

**Prompt:**

*I want to build a Node.js email scheduling app with the following features:*

* Upload multiple Excel (.xlsx) files containing lists of emails (with an "email" column).
* Store uploaded files on the server using the original filename (no database needed).
* Parse the Excel to extract emails, and schedule sending a custom message via SMTP (Gmail) to those emails at a user-specified date/time.
* Allow users to unsubscribe via a unique unsubscribe link included in each email.
* Provide a frontend with:

  * An index page to upload Excel, write the message, and select the schedule datetime.
  * A history page listing all uploaded Excel filenames.

    * Clicking a filename shows the list of emails from that file.
    * Option to download the original Excel file.
* Use dotenv for config like SMTP credentials.
* No database — keep unsubscribe list in memory (Set).
* Use Multer for file uploads.
* Use node-schedule for scheduling emails.
* Use XLSX library to read Excel files.
* Implement REST API endpoints to support the frontend functionality.
* Use Nodemailer to send emails.
* Provide HTML pages for:

  * Upload/schedule form
  * History + email list display + download link
  * Unsubscribe confirmation page

*Please provide complete working code for the server (server.js), the frontend pages (index.html, history.html, unsubscribe.html), the .env example, and instructions to run.*
